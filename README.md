# Region-Locator

## Problem Statement

A rectangle is partitioned into a number of disjoint regions. All regions have axis-parallel boundaries. Build a data structure such that the following query can be
answered in O(log n ) time: Given a point p, which region does it belong to? n refers to the number of boundary line segments. Assume any reasonable representation of the input. You need not explain how â€‹the data-structure is built, just describe what you will store and how you would answer a query.
